TBW: intro...  
use Prisma with the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/). The Serverless Framework simplifies deployment to Lambda. It provides a CLI that helps with workflow automation and AWS resource provisioning. See our guide on how to [deploy a Prisma project to AWS Lambda with the Serverless Framework](/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-aws-lambda).

## Binary targets in <inlinecode>schema.prisma</inlinecode>

The Prisma schema contains the following in the generator block:

```prisma
binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-1.0.x"]
```

This is necessary because the local runtime is different from the Lambda runtime. Add the `binaryTarget` to make the compatible Prisma Engine binary available. [Learn more](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options).

## Package Pattern in <inlinecode>serverless.yml</inlinecode>

The Serverless configuration file includes a package pattern that excludes all Prisma Engine binaries except for the one relevant for the Lambda runtime. This means that when Serverless packages your app for upload, it includes only one binary. This ensures the packaged archive is as small as possible.

```code file=serverless.yml no-copy
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-rhel-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

However, if you use `serverless-webpack`, then you cannot use this method. See [Deployment with serverless webpack](#deployment-with-serverless-webpack) for details.

## Lambdas with arm64 architectures

Lambda functions that use [arm64 architectures (AWS Graviton2 processor)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-arch.html#foundation-arch-adv) must use an `arm64` precompiled binary.

In the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, add the following:

```prisma file=schema.prisma
binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-arm64-openssl-1.0.x"]
```

Update the Serverless configuration file to package the `arm64` binary, as follows:

```code file=serverless.yml
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-linux-arm64-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

## Deployment with <inlinecode>serverless-webpack</inlinecode>

If you use `serverless-webpack`, then you can use the [serverless-webpack-prisma](https://github.com/danieluhm2004/serverless-webpack-prisma) plugin without any additional configuration. `serverless-webpack-prisma` does the following:

1. Copies your `schema.prisma` with the Webpack plugin.
2. Runs the `prisma generate` command. This means that there is no need to add the command to the webpack options separately.
3. Packages the correct Prisma engine used in the Lambda. This can save more than 40mb of capacity.

<details><summary>If you do not use webpack yet</summary>

Install the dependencies as follows:

```sh
npm install -D webpack serverless-webpack webpack-node-externals
```

If your project uses TypeScript, install `ts-loader`:

```sh
npm install -D ts-loader
```

Create a `webpack.config.js` file in the project root directory, and paste in the following configuration:

```javascript file=webpack.config.js
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires */
const path = require('path')
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals')
const slsw = require('serverless-webpack')
const { isLocal } = slsw.lib.webpack

module.exports = {
  target: 'node',
  stats: 'normal',
  entry: slsw.lib.entries,
  externals: [nodeExternals()],
  mode: isLocal ? 'development' : 'production',
  optimization: { concatenateModules: false },
  resolve: { extensions: ['.js'] },
  output: {
    libraryTarget: 'commonjs',
    filename: '[name].js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, '.webpack'),
  },
}
```

If you use TypeScript, insert the following configuration inside `exports`:

```javascript file=webpack.config.js
// ...initial config
module.exports = {
  // ...initial config
  resolve: { extensions: ['.js', '.ts'] },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        loader: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  // ...initial config
}
```

Refer to the [Serverless Webpack documentation](https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-webpack) for additional configuration.

</details>

To install the dev dependency, use the following command:

```sh
npm install -D serverless-webpack-prisma serverless
```

In `serverless.yml`, add `serverless-webpack` to the plugins list, as follows:

```yaml file=serverless.yml
plugins:
  - serverless-webpack
  - serverless-webpack-prisma

custom:
  webpack:
    includeModules: true
```

`serverless-webpack-prisma` automatically runs `prisma generate` so that you do not need to use the webpack script option separately as shown below.

```yaml file=serverless.yml
custom:
  webpack:
    packagerOptions:
      scripts:
        - prisma generate
```

`serverless-webpack-prisma` removes the unnecessary dependencies and packages the correct Prisma engine for your Lambda. Therefore, delete it in the `package.patterns` configuration in your `serverless.yml` file.

```yaml file=serverless.yml
package:
  patterns:
    - '!node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*'
    - 'node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-rhel-*'
    - '!node_modules/prisma/libquery_engine-*'
    - '!node_modules/@prisma/engines/**'
```

Now redeploy your application. To do so, run `serverless deploy`. The deployment output shows you that the correct Prisma Engine is packaged and distributed, as follows:

```code no-copy
Serverless: Copy prisma schema for app...
Serverless: Generate prisma client for app...
Serverless: Remove unused prisma engine:
Serverless: - node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-darwin.dylib.node
Serverless: - node_modules/@prisma/engines/introspection-engine-darwin
Serverless: - node_modules/@prisma/engines/libquery_engine-darwin.dylib.node
Serverless: - node_modules/@prisma/engines/migration-engine-darwin
Serverless: - node_modules/@prisma/engines/prisma-fmt-darwin
Serverless: Copying existing artifacts...
```

## Remove unneeded artifacts without the Serverless Framework

If you do not use the Serverless Framework, you can use the following method to remove any unneeded artifacts.

1. Create a zip script that only zips the files that your project needs. [Example script](https://github.com/prisma/ecosystem-tests/blob/dev/platforms-serverless/lambda/zip.sh).

2. Upload the zip. For example, to do this with the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), you might use a command similar to the following:

   ```terminal
   aws lambda update-function-code --function-name my-function --zip-file "fileb://lambda.zip"
   ```
