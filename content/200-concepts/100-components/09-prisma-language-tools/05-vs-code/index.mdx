## Syntax Highlighting

The Prisma VS Code extension defines grammar for the Prisma Schema Language so as to provides syntax highlighting.

## Colour Theme Validation

To ensure effective syntax highlighting, on detection of a VS Code colour theme that does not fully support Prisma, we emit the following warning:

> The VS Code Color Theme {currentTheme} you are using unfortunately does not fully support syntax highlighting. We suggest you switch to 'suggestedTheme' which does fully support it and will give you a better experience.

## Client File Watcher

Monitors for changes in the client types and will refresh the TypeScript language server on detected change.

## Insider

It is not reccomended to have both the Stable and Insider release of the Prisma VS Code extension enabled in a given workspace. On detection, we emit the following warning:

> You have both the Insider and stable Prisma VS Code extension installed. Please uninstall or disable one of them for a better experience.
